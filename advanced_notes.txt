Automatic Variable :
	- storage classes used to describe the features of variable/function 
		* include the scope , visibility and lif-time
		* help to trace the existence of a particular variable during runtime of program
	-The lifetime of variable is the time period during which variable exist in computer memeory 
		* some exist briefly , some are repeatedly created and destroyed , and others exist for the entire excution of program	
	- The scope of variable is where the variable can be referenced in program 
	
	- C provide four storage classes , indicate by their storage  calss specifiers
		* auto 
		* register 
		* extern
		* Static
	
	-The four storage class can be :
		* automatic storage duration 
		* static storage duration
		
    - All local variable have automatic storage
	- EXTERNAL : extern variable can be acces between two files
	- static varibale should not decalte inside a strcuture
		- if we need to define a globale varible whose value not to be accessed from another files we declare it as STATIC
	
##HEAP and STACK
		- There is 3 forms of memeory that you can use in program :
			* static 
			* stack
			* heap 
		Stack : is special region of memeory that store temporary variable 
			* used to store variable that at created inside a function 
			* easier to keep track of because the memory is only locally available in the function 
			* managed by CPU 
			* Grows and shrinks as variable are created destroyed inside function
			* There is lilit of variable can be stored in the stack
			* If a program tries to put too much information on the stack, stack overflow will ocuur 
			* over flow can occurs in situations where recursion is incorrectly used 
			* stack variable only exist while the function that created them is runnig 
			* Local variable only
			* variable cannot be resize
			
			
		Heap : 
			* opposite of stacks 
			* a hierarchical data structure 
			* The heap is a large pool of memeory that can be used dynamically 
			* memory is not automaticaly managed 
			* The heap managed by the programmer 
			* The memory is acces by pointer
			*  variable can acces globaly 
			* no limit on memeory size
			* programmer reponsible tomanage memeory 
			* variable can be resize using realloc()
			
		The define #:
			* Way to tell the compiler sonthings and run before the compiler 
			* Ex: 	#define Yes 1
					#define TWO_PI 2.0*3.14
					#define NULL 0
			* Help to make the programm more readly extendable and readable
