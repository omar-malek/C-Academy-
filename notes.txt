Ternary statement:
tackes three operand
Conditions ? expression1: expression2
x= y>7 ? 25 : 50   means result set to 25 if y is greater than 7, or to 50 otherwise



many if else ==> use switch


for syntax:
for (start condition; continuation condition; action_per_condition)
		Loop statement;
The condition can be multiple




While and For loop choos
		-While loo is beter for logic controlled
		- For loop is beter for counter control loop


Break is often used to leave a loop when there are two seperate reasons to leave 



--Array 

// multidimentional array
int number[3][4]={
					{10,20,30,40},
					{10,20,30,40},
					{10,20,30,40}
				};
					
you need three nested loop to process 3 dimetional array 

## String 
strchr()
strstr() ---> most usuful 
Tokenization a string 
strtok()

analuzing string :
islower()
isdigit()
.......

## Pointer

use the asterisk to dereference the pointer 
 *pNumber = 25 
  int * pNumber ;
  pNumber =&Variable;
